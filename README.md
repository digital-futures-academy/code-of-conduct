# Code of Conduct

## Our thoughts on diversity at Digital Futures

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and as equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities and people with criminal convictions.


## What is a code of conduct?

A code of conduct is a set of guidelines that outlines behaviours that represent a community, and behaviours that do  not.

## Why have one?

It's an important part of establishing an inclusive culture, and it's important
to us that everyone feels welcome and supported in our community. A code of
conduct helps make this inclusive culture more explicit and obvious to everyone,
and outlines a common agreed set of behaviours to help keep each other to account. It
is however, only part of the solution to maintaining an open, honest, and
inclusive culture.

## What is acceptable behaviour?

#### Expected Behaviour
- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Please avoid making assumptions. If you aren’t aware of what someone’s gender is, and you can’t figure out what pronoun to use, just ask or look at our name tags, where you may find their name and favourite pronoun!
- Please ask before touching anyone at our events. It’s easy, and the worst thing that happens is someone says no! That includes hugging – you might not know that it makes some people uncomfortable, but it does, so please ask first.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and the other participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

#### What is unacceptable behaviour?

The following types of behaviour are unacceptable at Digital Futures, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations.

##### Abusive behaviour
- Harassment — including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.
- Threats — threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

##### Unwelcoming behaviour
- Blatant -isms—saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behaviour, and is not allowed at Digital Futures.
- Maliciousness towards other Digital Futures community members —deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that they don’t belong at Digital Futures.
- Being especially unpleasant—for example, if we’ve received reports from multiple community members of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behaviour.
- Bringing guests into the Digital Futures space—as per our guest policy, you may not bring non-DF guests into the space except in very specific contexts. It’s important that everyone can trust that only other community members  will be in the space—it allows people to speak freely, feel comfortable leaving their belongings unattended, and trust that everyone is being held to the expectations in this code of conduct. This is different from all the rest, but is nevertheless a code of conduct violation.


## Reporting

#### Why should I report?
You are responsible for making Digital Futures a safe and comfortable space for everyone. Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. Digital Futures staff members are not around the DF space or at DF events all the time, so we cannot enforce the code of conduct without your help.

The consequences for the DF community of not reporting bad behaviour outweigh the consequences for one person of reporting it. We sometimes hear “I don’t want X person to meet consequences because I told someone about their bad behaviour.” Consider the impact on everyone else in the community of letting their behaviour continue unchecked.
Digital Futures works best as a community-first community because of shared trust amongst everyone. Reporting code of conduct violations helps us identify when this trust is broken, to prevent that from happening in the future.

#### Where and how to report
Please report all code of conduct violations using our [reporting form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=j9LsJNoACUCYjVxKUiqhGDowJBD0AjBKl2D9jqqe0ZVUQ1BNUEZLTldRMThHUE84QkQ4WE5BOFdaOS4u). If you would rather discuss the matter in person with a staff member, email us to schedule a time to talk.

In your report, please include:

- Your name—this is incredibly helpful for us to be able to follow up with you, and ask questions to better understand the situation. The form allows you to report anonymously. Please only use this option if you really need to, and know that we might not be able to take action without knowing who you are. In any case, provide an email address so we can correspond with you about the report. The third-party reporting tool we’re using anonymizes communication, so we never see the email address you provide if you chose to submit anonymously.
- A detailed description of what happened
If the violation happened online, please link to or send us the relevant text.
If the violation happened in person, please detail what exactly the other person said or did. In order to take action, we need to know the concrete actions that someone took.
- Where and when the incident happened
- Any other relevant context. Do you have examples of a pattern of similar behaviour from this person before? Do you have a relationship with this person outside of Digital Futures?
- If/how you’ve already responded—this lets us know the current state of the situation.
